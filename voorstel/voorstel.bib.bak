  abstract    = {Almost every application or platform that is developed nowadays includes a user onboarding experience. Onboarding is a process that starts the moment users enter an application and it aims to show the benefits of using the application, teach how the functionality works and motivate users to return. When the target application is considered a complex software, the teaching methodology needs to be carefully studied and designed. Through the example of a complex project management software, this master thesis aims to develop an in-app teaching interface that allows the users to understand the different functionalities and improve their work performance in a complex application. In this work, we developed an integrated learning platform as a result of methodical research-oriented design processes. The outcome of the research is a modular onboarding experience called the Learning Center. It includes a collection of courses based on video tutorials and interactive guided tours. Gamification elements such as progress bars and checklists are included as a way to engage users and encourage them to complete the courses. User tests showed an improvement in functionality understanding and a reduction in error rates. The Learning Center was considered useful and adequately approached. Future research includes making the appropriate learning material directly available from each software feature. },

  title       = {Guidelines for Onboarding : Developing guidelines by testing a process for onboarding.},
  year        = {2018},
  abstract    = {Smartphones and applications are becoming more and more popular. Although, the user knowledge varies. Onboarding has been described in other previous studies as a tool for costumers to get a better understanding of applications. This thesis aims to develop guidelines for onboarding by investigating previous studies and by comparing different applications. By investigating to what extent onboarding is beneficial for an application, the question of if it is worth the time and effort for a company to develop an onboarding is discussed. A hi- fi onboarding prototype will be developed to be able to test the guidelines. Simplicity, knowledge of the user, smooth navigation and user satisfaction are a few things that were kept in mind from previous studies when developing the guidelines. To be able to develop guidelines, questions regarding mobile devices, application developing, user behaviour and manuals have also been studied. Interviews combined with observations allowed for an analysis of the guidelines by conducting an A/B test. One group of test subjects received an application with onboarding, and the other group received the same application without onboarding. The result of the A/B test showed that onboarding helped the user to find functions that could be considered difficult to locate. The test also showed that many people often skip onboarding, but people that complete the onboarding process gets a better understanding of the application faster. Guidelines for an efficient development of an onboarding are presented. In conclusion, onboarding is a tool that should be utilized if the developer aims to allow as many users as possible to understand the full potential of the application as fast as possible. },
